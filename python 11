def read_file_character_by_character(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            while True:
                char = file.read(1)
                if not char:
                    break
                print(char)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"File '{filename}' not found.")

# Test the function
file_name = input("Enter the file name: ")
read_file_character_by_character(file_name)
